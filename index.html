                <p><b>Description: </b></p>
                <p>Filtration, Annotation, and Storage Tool (FAST) is a tool for managing, annotating and filtering large data sets from tests such as large panels,<br>
                  exomes, and genomes. The system facilitates the determination of which variants from a case are the most clinically relevant and will ultimately be<br>
                  reported. A laboratory can load both sample (patient) data and annotation (external information from publicly and privately available databases) data<br>
                  into FAST. The sample and annotation data are then combined to allow systematic curation and filtering of the identified variants. The laboratory can<br>
                  filter this data using saved filters and/or ad hoc filters for searching. Once the laboratory has identified the final set of variants for reporting,<br>
                  they are either downloaded or sent to Sunquest Mitogen™ Genetics Lab for reporting. Lab 6.2 is designed to assist you in drafting molecular diagnostic<br>
                  test reports. It also assists in tracking data used as input in the report generation process. Reports generated by Mitogen genetics Lab must be reviewed<br>
                  and approved for accuracy by experienced, trained and properly credentialed medical personnel prior to release for clinical use.
